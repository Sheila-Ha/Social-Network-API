  ### User Story  
*  As A social media startup  
    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database  
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data      
  ### Acceptance Criteria
*  GIVEN a social network API  
*  
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application  
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database  

    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts  
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON  

    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia  
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database  

    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia  
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and delete friends to a userâ€™s friend list
